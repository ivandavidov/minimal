# Use predefined '.config' file when building the kernel. This overrides the
# config generation in 'xx_build_kernel.sh' and the build process uses the
# config file provided in this parameter. Place the configuration file here:
#
# minimal_config/kernel.config
#
USE_PREDEFINED_KERNEL_CONFIG=false

# Use predefined '.config' file when building BusyBox. This overrides the config
# generation in 'xx_build_busybox.sh' and the build process uses the config file
# provided in this parameter. Place the configuration file here:
#
# minimal_config/busybox.config
#
USE_PREDEFINED_BUSYBOX_CONFIG=false

# Define the overlay type to use. Possible values are 'sparse' and 'folder'. You
# can use any other value, no value, or comment the property in order to disable
# it. Put your overlay content in the folder 'minimal_overlay' and it will be
# automatically merged with the root file system on boot. The build process
# creates either '/minimal.img/rootfs' or '/minimal/rootfs' (read below) and
# this folder contains all overlay content in it. The build process also creates
# '/minimal.img/work' or '/minimal/work'. This folder is used by the overlay
# driver to store modifications related to the read only storage. If the overlay
# media is writeable, then all changes on the root filesystem are automatically
# persisted and preserved on reboot.
#
# sparse - use sparse file 'minimal.img' with hardcoded maximal size of 1MB (see
#          xx_generate_iso.sh). The generated ISO image is larger because the
#          sparse file is treated as regular file. This option requires root
#          permissions or otherwise sparse file generation is silently skipped.
#          Sparse file is treated as separate disk image and works fine on FAT. 
#
# folder - use normal folder structure (/minimal/). Note that this doesn't work
#          if the file system is FAT because FAT requires special handling, e.g.
#          POSIX overlay (http://sf.net/p/posixovl). This is the default option
#          because it doesn't require root permissions.
#
OVERLAY_TYPE=folder

# Use already downloaded source bundles instead of downloading them from
# internet. This is useful when you have already downloaded the sources and have
# no internet connection. Or if you want to share your version of "Minimal Linux
# Live" with predefined sources.
USE_LOCAL_SOURCE=false

# Copy "Minimal Linux Live" source files and folders in '/src' inside initramfs.
# The default value is 'true'. You can use any other value, no value, or comment
# the property in order to disable it.
COPY_SOURCE_ROOTFS=true

# Copy "Minimal Linux Live" source files and folders in '/src' on the ISO image.
# The default value is 'true'. You can use any other value, no value, or comment
# the property in order to disable it.
COPY_SOURCE_ISO=true

# This property defines one or more additional overlay software pieces which
# will be generated and placed in the 'work/src/minimal_overlay' folder. These
# software pieces will be visible and fully usable after boot. By default this
# property is disabled because the build process for most of the software is
# host specific and may not work out of the box. Note that if you build any
# overlay software and you are using sparse image file for the overlay structure
# then most probably something will go wrong because the overlay software
# requires more than 1MB free space. The solution is to use folder overlay or to
# edit the script 'xx_generate_iso.sh' and set it to create sparse image file
# with bigger size.
#
# Currently available overlay software:
#
# glibc_full - all core GNU C libraries (useful if other software is included).
# links      - text browser.
# dropbear   - SSH server and client.
# java       - installs Oracle's JRE or JDK. Manual preparations are required.
# felix      - Apache Felix OSGi framework.
#
# Refer to the README file for more information.

#OVERLAY_BUNDLES=glibc_full,links,dropbear,java,felix

# This property enables the standard penguin boot logo in the upper left corner
# of the screen. The property is used in 'xx_build_kernel.sh'. The default value
# is 'true' for demonstration purposes.
USE_BOOT_LOGO=true

# This property is the multiplicator which is used during the build process. The
# total number of each 'make' jobs will be equal to the number of detected CPU
# cores mutiplied by this property. For example, if you set this property with
# value '2' and if your CPU has 4 cores, then the number of 'make' jobs will be
# 4 * 2 = 8. Don't change this property unless you know what 'make' jobs are! 
JOB_FACTOR=1
