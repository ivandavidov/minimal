  Usage: $0 [OPTION]
  This utility generates 20MB sparse file 'hdd.img' which can be used as QEMU
  disk image where all filesystem changes from the live session are persisted.
  
  -e, --empty     Create empty sparse image file which is not formatted.
  -f, --folder    Create sparse image file formatted with Ext2 filesystem which
                  contains compatible overlay folder structure.
  -h, --help      Prints this help information.
  -s, --sparse    Create sparse image file formatted with FAT filesystem which
                  contains sparse image file 'minimal.img' (1MB) formatted with
                  Ext2 filesystem which contains the actual overlay structure.
