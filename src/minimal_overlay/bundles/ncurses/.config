# TODO - Many other bundles depend on 'curses header-files'
# and their build will fail if these headers are missing.
# However, these headers are not provided by the overlay
# bundle 'ncurses'. On Ubuntu you can add the headers with
# the following command:
#
#   sudo apt install libncurses-dev
#
# You can find the latest ncurses archives here:
#
#   https://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ncurses/
