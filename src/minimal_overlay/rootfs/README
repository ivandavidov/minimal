   This file can be found in the folder 'minimal/src/minimal_overlay/rootfs'

 You can use the above folder to put your own content (files and folders) which
 will be visible in the root folder of your 'Minimal Linux Live' system, just
 like this file is visible. The files/folders will override the content in the
 root folder, so be careful what you put there because you may break your OS.
 If the boot media is writable, then all changes on the root file system are
 persisted automatically, so be very careful what you do when you use the
 overlay system.

 Another way to add software in 'Minimal Linux Live' is by using the overlay
 bundles which add the software while the OS is being built. Check the
 'mll_hello' overlay bundle in folder 'minimal/src/minimal_overlay/bundles'.

 You can also add software in 'Minimal Linux Live' while the OS is running with
 the 'static_get' overlay bundle. Use 'static-get -s <package>' to search for
 packages and 'static-get -i <package>' to install the package.

 Check the '.config' file in the source folder for more details regarding the
 overlay system and how to use it.

   Have fun with 'Minimal Linux Live'! :)
