# Note that this virtual hard disk has to be created in advance. You can use
# the script 'generate_hdd.sh' to generate the hard disk image file. Once you
# have hard disk image, you can use it as overlay device and persist all your
# changes. See the '.config' file for more information on the overlay support.
